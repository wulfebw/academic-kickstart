title: "Deep Reinforcement Learning for Collision Avoidance"
summary: "We learn UAV collision avoidance policies directly from a simulator with a Deep Q-Network (DQN). This approach not only solves for policies more quickly than value iteration, but also arrives at safer and more efficient solutions by learning a direct mapping from the state space instead of discretizing it."
