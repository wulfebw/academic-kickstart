title: "Predicting Social Interaction Outcomes"
summary: "In this project, I analyzed a set of ~2,000 pairwise social encounters. Using the audio, visual, and network features from those interactions, I was able to predict their outcomes with about 85% accuracy. While I am more focused on reinforcement learning now, I still think this topic is interesting, and in particular believe that enabling computers to intelligently interact with people (e.g., in healthcare or educational settings) would be widely beneficial."
