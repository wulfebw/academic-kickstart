title: "Geo-localization of Street View Images"
summary: Given a random, street-level image of a city from around the world, could you identify where the picture was taken? In this project, we collected a dataset of 100,000 images from ten cities, and trained a convolutional neural network to predict the city from the image. We found that the network successfully identifies the city with ~75% accuracy. Research tackling this project at a much larger scale was published concurrently (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05314" class="md-link">PlaNet</a>)
