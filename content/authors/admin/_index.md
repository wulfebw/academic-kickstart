<p class="about-p">
I'm currently working on decision making and prediction for autonomous driving at the <a href="">Toyota Research Institute</a>.

I previously completed a master's degree in computer science at Stanford, where I focused on reinforcement learning and decision making as part of the <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/group/sisl/cgi-bin/wordpress/people/" class="md-link">Stanford Intelligent Systems Laboratory</a> advised by <a class="md-link" href="http://mykel.kochenderfer.com/">Mykel Kochenderfer</a>.

During my master's, I interned at Adobe Research where I was advised by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hung-bui-2a9b244" class="md-link">Hung Bui</a>. We performed research around imitation learning and its applications in artistic domains.

As an undergraduate student I studied computer science at Vanderbilt University, where I performed autonomous UAV research with my advisor <a href="http://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/bio/julie-adams" class="md-link">Julie Adams</a> as part of the <a href="http://eecs.vanderbilt.edu/research/hmtl/wp/" class="md-link">Human-Machine Teaming Lab</a>. I also worked with <a href="http://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/bio/eugene-vorobeychik" class="md-link">Eugene Vorobeychik</a> on a project dealing with social interaction analysis, which is how I originally became interested in machine learning.
